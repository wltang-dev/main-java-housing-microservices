# WeChat Housing Microservices!
[![Build and Push Docker Images](https://github.com/wltang-dev/main-java-housing-microservices/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wltang-dev/main-java-housing-microservices/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This project is a microservices-based backend system that **replicates the core functionality** of a WeChat mini-program I previously developed while working in a real-world production environment. The system was designed to support flash sale ("æŠ¢æˆ¿") features for a housing application.

---

##  Key Highlights
###  Distributed Microservices + High-Concurrency Safe Design
The system is built on a Spring Cloud-based microservices architecture, where each core domain (user, housing, gateway, etc.) is a separate service registered via Eureka and communicating through OpenFeign.

To ensure data consistency and system stability under high-concurrency scenarios such as housing flash sales:

A Redis-based distributed lock mechanism is used to ensure atomic operations and prevent overselling.

Lock acquisition uses timeouts (e.g., tryLock for 2 seconds) to avoid deadlocks and fallback gracefully.

Services are stateless and horizontally scalable, aligning with cloud-native principles and enabling high availability.

 This combination demonstrates not just modular architecture, but also a real-world approach to concurrency, fault tolerance, and distributed coordination.

###  Dual-Layer Authentication & Authorization Design

This project features **2 layers of request filtering** to ensure secure access control:

1. **Global JWT Gateway Filter** (`AuthGlobalFilter.java`)
- Intercepts all incoming requests at the gateway
- Allows unauthenticated access to `/api/auth/*` endpoints
- Rejects or passes valid `Bearer` tokens to downstream services

2. **Custom Role-Based AOP + Annotation (@LoginRequired)**
- Implemented via `LoginInterceptor` using Spring AOP
- Supports declarative method-level access like:

```dash
    @LoginRequired(Role.ADMIN)
    public void deleteUser(...) { ... }
```
- Uses **reflection**, **JWT parsing**, and **ThreadLocal context** to determine access rights dynamically
- Encapsulates authorization logic cleanly outside of business code

This design showcases proficiency in:
- Java annotations & AOP
- Spring Security concepts
- Clean architecture patterns
- Fine-grained permission control with custom logic

### Full-Stack Functionality with React Frontend

A lightweight **React frontend** is included (`frontend/` folder) to simulate user flows:

-  User registration & login
-  View house listings
-  Reserve / purchase houses (via API)
-  Fully integrated with the backend gateway (`api-gateway`)

This allows testing the complete end-to-end business flow from browser to backend microservices.

## Project Description

The current version focuses on rebuilding the backend architecture using Spring Cloud and related technologies. While MySQL has not been integrated yet (as it's not essential at this stage), Redis has been added to simulate distributed caching and session control.
The project is still under active development and will continue to be enhanced with more components.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Java 17 + Spring Boot 3.x**
- **Spring Cloud**
- **Spring Cloud Gateway**
- **Eureka (Service Discovery)**
- **Spring Security + JWT**
- **Spring Cloud OpenFeign**
- **Lombok, MapStruct, JPA**
- **Redis** â€” Caching & Distributed Locking
- **H2 Database** â€” Lightweight in-memory DB
- **Maven**
- **React + Axios + Ant Design (frontend)**
- **Postman** â€” API testing
- **ThreadLocal (UserContext)**
- **JUnit 5, Mockito, WebTestClient**
- **GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**
- **Docker & Kubernetes**

---

## Modules Overview

- **eureka-server**: Service discovery and registry
- **api-gateway**: Central routing and filtering with JWT validation
- **user-service**: Handles registration, login, role-based access
- **house-admin-service**: Admin-specific house management
- **house-client-service**: Client-facing APIs for browsing, buying
- **frontend**: React client to test key flows
- **common**: Shared models, security utils, annotations

---

##  Test Coverage

This project includes both unit and integration tests:

### `user-service`
- `AuthControllerTest` with **JUnit + Mockito**
- Validates:
  - User registration
  - Login
  - Profile access via token

### `api-gateway`
- `AuthGlobalFilterTest` with **WebTestClient**
- Simulates:
  - Requests with/without tokens
  - Proper rejection or forwarding
- See `screenshots/gateway-login-register-test-success.png` for sample
